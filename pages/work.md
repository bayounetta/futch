## WHAT HAVE I DONE!

Some examples of my work can be found in [Mozilla's Central Mercurial Repository](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/log?rev=jewilde).

I also work on Mozilla's [Updatebot](https://github.com/mozilla-services/updatebot/) for third-party dependencies.

The team I'm a part of [tweets](https://twitter.com/attackndefense) and [blogs](https://blog.mozilla.org/attack-and-defense/) about bug bounties and low-level specifics for security researchers.

There's other bits of public and non-public code out there but you can find most of it on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/metalcanine) which should not be confused for my [résumé](/static/RESUME_PUBLIC.pdf)
