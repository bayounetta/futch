# WHAT HAVE I DONE!?!?

---

#### some examples of my work can be found in [Mozilla's Central Mercurial Repository](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/log?rev=jewilde)

#### I also work on Mozilla's [Updatebot](https://github.com/mozilla-services/updatebot/) for keeping vendored third-party dependencies up to date

#### there's other bits of my code out running wild and free in the sky, hiding in strange corners of the web, and on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/metalcanine) which should not be confused for my [résumé](/static/RESUME_PUBLIC.pdf)

[//]: # 'TODO: add public copy of resume'
